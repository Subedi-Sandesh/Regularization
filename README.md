Regularization is the one of the way to reduce overfitting. It does so by reducing the size of paramentrs w_j.
Modified cost function consists of two terms, viz. mean squared term and regularization term.
For modifed gradient descent, we can just change w_j and simultaneously update so to reach the minimum.
